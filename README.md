Day - 1 : ( PLAIN JS )
    It includes two assignments 

    Assignment - 1 :
        In assignment 1, we are provided with 3 concentric circles and on clicking circles, only that particular circle should display alert message and others shouldn't...

    Assignment - 2 :
        In assignment 2, we are provided with 9 buttons in matrix format numbered row-wise from 1 ...9.
        Here on clicking middle most button, numbers should get rotated by one position towards right.
        Only outer circle is rotated in clockwise movement i.e shift by 1 position.

Day - 2, 3 : ( ANGULAR NOT ANGULARJS)
    It includes three assignments 

    Assignment - 3 :
        In assignment 3, data fetching is done from API in angular such that when a button is clicked in parent component , it displays data in child component.

    Assignment - 4 :
        In assignment 4, here currency converter is made in angular.We select given currencies on either sides and also amount of currency 1 to find its equivalent amount in currency 2.

    Assignment - 5 :
        In assignment 5, here we have to displayed data in child table initially using API but this time we have json file in local system itself and we have used API call instead of direct importing of file.
        Now, we have two choices, name and age of person and accordingly, on radio button selection operation, data gets displayed in child 2 after receiving data from child 1 via parent i.e 
        child1 performs radio button selection of name or age then that choice is passed to parent and thus that choice now passed to child2 and accordingly api call and sort data.
        Initially data is printed randomly as stored in files and later sorted on demand.
        Important is data cannot be passed directly among child 1 -> child2 so it gets passed via parents.
